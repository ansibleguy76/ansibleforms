// Blanket auditing for state-changing HTTP requests.
//
// This is mounted once and covers every non-GET v2 request, which buys two things
// that per-model calls do not :
//
//  - DENIED attempts. A 401/403 never reaches a model, so an explicit Audit.log()
//    in the model can never record it - yet "someone repeatedly tried to change
//    roles and was refused" is the single most useful line in a security review.
//  - No blind spots as routes are added. A new endpoint is audited the day it
//    exists, without anyone remembering to instrument it.
//
// Models still log their own semantic events on top of this (an option delta, an
// approval) where the interesting part is WHAT changed, which only they know.

// GETs are reads : auditing them would bury the mutations in noise. The polling
// endpoints alone would produce thousands of rows an hour.
const AUDITED_METHODS = ['POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE'];

// Login is deliberately excluded : the login controller logs it itself, with the
// attempted username, which this layer cannot see (there is no req.user yet on a
// failed attempt, so every failure would be an anonymous 'auth.login' with no
// indication of who was tried).
const SKIP = [/^\/api\/v\d+\/auth\//, /^\/api\/v\d+\/token/];

// '/api/v2/settings/config' -> 'settings.config'. Route PARAMETERS are dropped so that
// 'user.42' and 'user.43' collapse into one action and the id lands in `target`, where it
// can be filtered on.
//
// Pass the matched route pattern ('/:name/pull/') rather than the concrete path when one
// is available. The id-ish fallback below only recognises numeric and hex segments, so
// 'POST /repository/myrepo/pull' used to be recorded as 'repository.myrepo.pull.create' -
// a distinct action per repository, which filled the facets dropdown with junk and made
// the action column impossible to aggregate or filter on. Named parameters are common
// here (:name, :folder, :backupName), so this was not an edge case.
/**
 * @param {boolean} routeMatched Whether express actually dispatched to a route handler
 *   (i.e. `req.route` was set). When it did NOT - an app-level guard such as `authobj`
 *   or checkSettingsMiddleware refused before routing - every path segment after the
 *   resource is CALLER CONTROLLED, and must not reach the action.
 *
 *   That was the 404 guard's hole. A 404 is skipped precisely so an unauthenticated
 *   caller cannot write one row per request with an action of its own choosing, but
 *   `DELETE /api/v2/repository/<anything>` answers 401, not 404 - so it wrote
 *   `repository.<anything>.delete`. `Audit.facets` is an unbounded SELECT DISTINCT
 *   action feeding the admin's filter dropdown, so that is both an anti-forensics
 *   flood and unbounded junk in the UI. Keeping only the resource segment bounds the
 *   vocabulary to the mount list: a path that matches no mount 404s and is skipped.

  // repository"). Verified: at finish time baseUrl is '/api/v2/repository' and path is

//     it appears here.
// Only a short scalar is accepted, so an object or an array under one of these names cannot
// smuggle a document in; Audit.log clamps to the column width as a second line of defence.
