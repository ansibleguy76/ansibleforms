// Semantic auditing for config.yaml writes.

// The generic audit middleware already records THAT someone saved the config and
// whether it worked. It cannot record WHAT changed, because only this layer sees the
// old and the new document. That gap matters most for roles : a privilege escalation
// shipped here once where renaming a role to `admin` silently granted full admin
// while the editor showed the switches off. An option delta is what makes that kind
// of change visible after the fact.

// Compare the option maps of one role. An option that is ABSENT in one side and
// explicit in the other is a real change, not a no-op : most options default to true
// (a few to isAdmin) and the server ANDs them across every role a user matches, so
// `undefined -> false` genuinely removes a permission. See the role option notes in
// CLAUDE.md before changing this.
