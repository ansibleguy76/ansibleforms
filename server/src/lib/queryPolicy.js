// Which characters a value has to be protected against depends on the ENGINE, and this
// product talks to five of them (query.model.js dispatches on the credential's db_type).
//
//  - mysql/mariadb treat a backslash as an escape character, so `x\` pasted before the
//    author's closing quote would swallow it. Doubling it is REQUIRED there.
//  - postgres (standard_conforming_strings, the default since 9.1), mssql and oracle do
//    NOT. Doubling a backslash there is not a safety measure, it is data corruption -
//    `DOMAIN\user` and `C:\path` are exactly the values this product carries around.
//  - mongodb is not SQL at all : mongodb.js JSON.parses the query, so a value has to be
//    escaped for a JSON string body. Doubling a single quote did nothing there while an
//    embedded double quote broke the document outright.
//
// Listed by the engines that DO NOT need the backslash doubled, never by the ones that do,
// so anything unknown or absent gets the strictest rules. That is the direction to fail in:
// over-escaping is a wrong value, under-escaping is an injection - and it matches
// query.model.js's own `cred.db_type || "mysql"` default. (query.model.js refuses an
// unrecognised type outright, so this is belt and braces, but this function is the one
// place that decides and it should not depend on that.)
