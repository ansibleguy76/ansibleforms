// Where a job runs. A runner is
//   { type, capabilities: { playbook, template }, launch(ctx), cancel(ctx), resume?(ctx) }
// resume(ctx) follows again a job its node stopped following (lib/jobResume.js), resolving
// once it ended, null when the runner no longer knows it ; ctx = { jobId, runner, job }.
// launch(ctx) resolves when the job has ended (a multistep waits for its steps on it) ;
// ctx = { jobId, extravars, credentialMap, ... }. The approval gate is not a runner's
// business : runners/orchestrator.js passes a job on only once it may run.
