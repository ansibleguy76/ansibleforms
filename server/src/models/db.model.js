//- MYSQL Module — shared connection pool
//
// All queries go through a single shared mysql2 connection pool (no more
// per-request createConnection/end cycles). Public API:
//   mysql.do(query, vars)  - run a query on a pool connection
//   mysql.end()            - close the pool (graceful shutdown)
//
// NOTE: multipleStatements is left enabled because schema bootstrap may run
// multi-statement DDL via mysql.do at startup. All runtime queries use
// parameterized `?` placeholders, so this does not introduce SQL injection
// risk in normal operation. Be careful when adding any code that concatenates
// user input into a query string.

// pool and holds that, not the pool reference - so a swap mid-transaction cannot split it
// across two pools. Single queries through MySql.do are atomic. Only new acquisitions see the
// new pool, and the old one is drained rather than killed: mysql2's end() waits for its

 * connections silently stopped honouring `ON DELETE CASCADE`, and a job deletion that
 * happened to land on it orphaned its job_output rows for good.
 *
 * The connection is discarded on SUCCESS too, because `USE AnsibleForms` also persists:
 * a connection carrying a default schema makes unqualified table names work on that one
