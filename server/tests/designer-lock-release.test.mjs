// The designer lock is exclusive and survives restarts (it is a file, persistent/
// ansibleForms.lock), so a request that claims it and does not hand it back makes every
// later config save, import and export answer 423 until somebody unlocks it by hand.
//
// restore() got this right - it tracks whether THIS request took the lock and releases it
// in a finally. save() did not: it claimed the lock whenever it was free and never
// released it, and its empty-body check returned 400 after the claim, so even a malformed
// request stranded it.
//
// Only lock.free may be released. lock.match means the designer already held it before the
// call and expects to keep it for the rest of the session.
