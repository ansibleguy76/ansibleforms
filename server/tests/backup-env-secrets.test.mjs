// A backup must never carry ENCRYPTION_SECRET or ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET.
//
// The dump beside the environment file holds every stored credential as AES ciphertext, so
// shipping the key in the same folder defeats it - and a backup travels: rsync, a support
// bundle, a playbook that reads persistent/. Neither secret is readable through the API at
// all (REFUSED in envSettings, redacted by GET /api/v2/config/env), so it must not be
// readable from a backup either.
//
// The filter used to be a hand written line pattern that did not recognise dotenv's
// optional `export ` prefix. `export ENCRYPTION_SECRET='...'` was therefore read by the
// application as a real value and NOT recognised by the filter, and the key went into
// every backup verbatim. That form is not exotic - it is what you write when the file is
// also meant to be sourced, which this project's own documentation does.
//
// So the rule under test is not "does this one pattern work" but "does the filter agree
// with the reader", which is why every case below is asserted with dotenv itself.
