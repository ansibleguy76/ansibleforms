// The schedule queue has a concurrency guard that was dead.
//
// init/index.js refuses to dequeue while any schedule is state='running', and the cron
// trigger refuses to queue one that is 'running' or 'queued'. But NOTHING ever wrote
// 'running': queue() wrote 'queued' and launch() wrote 'idle' when it was done. So the
// row stayed 'queued' for the whole run and the processor's next pass, 10 seconds later,
// found the same queued schedule and launched it again.
//
// Worse, launch() parsed extra_vars BEFORE its try block, so a schedule whose extra_vars
// were not a dictionary threw out of launch() with the row still 'queued' - and the
// processor picked it straight back up, for ever.
