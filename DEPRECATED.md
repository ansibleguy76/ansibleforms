# Deprecated Features

Nothing is deprecated right now.

## Removed in 7.0.0

Everything 6.x marked as deprecated was removed in 7.0.0. The upgrade guide
([docs/upgrade-7.md](docs/upgrade-7.md), on the site under *Upgrading to 7*) says what
replaces each item and how to move over while still on 6.5.

| Removed | Replacement | Deprecated since |
|---|---|---|
| `forms.yaml`, forms in the base config | `config.yaml` + one file per form in `forms/` | 6.0.0 |
| `FORMS_PATH` | `CONFIG_PATH` + `FORMS_FOLDER_PATH` | 6.0.0 |
| `ENABLE_FORMS_YAML_IN_DATABASE` | `ENABLE_CONFIG_IN_DATABASE` | 6.0.0 |
| the `table` field type (`tableFields`, `insertColumns`, `readonlyColumns`, `tableTitleAdd/Edit`) | a `list` field with a `subform` | 6.2.0 |
| API v1 (`/api/v1/*`) | API v2 | 6.2.x |
| `disableRelaunch` | `allowRelaunch: false` | 6.3.0 |
| `noOutput` | `output: false` | 6.3.0 |
| `enableLogin` (role option) | `allowLogin` | 6.3.0 |
| datasources and data schemas (their tables are dropped), the AnsibleForms Galaxy collection | none - an import runs as a playbook of your own | 7.0.0 |

6.x keeps getting patch releases from the `release/6.x` branch.

## Deprecating something

Mark it here with its replacement and the version, log a warning when it is used, and
remove it in the next major.
