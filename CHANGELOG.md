# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

-   multi default in enum field broken
-   verbose was not working well
-   textarea field in table field
-   placeholder (issue 320)
-   scrollbar (issue 318)
-   EntraId groups (issue 316)

## Added

-   updateMarker to table field
-   multi awx (314)
-   backup/restore api (/api/v2/database (get, post/backup, post/restore?folder=))
-   new role option allowDatabaseOps

### Changed

-   Backend rewritten to ESM (export default / import) -> no more "require" and no more "babel" and no more compiled code
-   Parsing of forms rewritten with individual form validation, should be more stable and faster
-   Backend bumped to Node.js 20
-   Most packages are updated to latest versions
-   Frontend rewritten to work with Vite (still vue2 for now) -> no more "webpack"
-   New sass-dart and bumped bulma framework to 1.0.4
-   Password decryption had a bug in v6beta

### Breaking Changes

-   Since "require" can not be used anymore, the backend code is now ESM only.
    This means that you can not use "require" anymore, but you can use "import" and "export default".  Than means that custom functions must be rewritten to use the new ESM syntax. (/functions/custom.js is an example where this could break)
-   Maybe not breaking, but the old theme is broken for bulma v1, so it might look a bit different here and there. (but note that v6 will have bootstrap)
-   Since many packages are updated, I might have missed some breaking changes like OIDC, AzureAD.  Ldap has been tested and works.

## [5.0.10] - 2025-06-05

### Added

-   LOG_TZ env var for timezone (both for logging and returning job logs)  Client convertion is disabled, so the client will always show the time in the timezone of the server.
-   Added new role option `enableLogin` to allow login for this role.  If not set, login is enabled.  Set to false on the public role to disable login overall, and set to true of the roles that should allow login.
-   fn.fnRestAdvanced allows 3 placeholderfunctions (base64, username and password)
-   fn.fnRestAdvanced allows a new "raw" parameter to return the data + the response_headers
