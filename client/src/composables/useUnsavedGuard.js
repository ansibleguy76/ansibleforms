/**
 * Warn before unsaved changes are thrown away.
 *
 * The designer implements both halves of this itself (a beforeunload listener and an
 * onBeforeRouteLeave that reuses its dirty modal). The three visual config editors -
 * Categories, Roles and Constants - were built from the same buffers and got neither, so
 * expanding eight roles, flipping thirty switches and then clicking Users in the sidebar
 * discarded everything silently. That is the same amount of work as a designer session.
 *
 * Leaving for another page asks in the app's Unsaved changes dialog (AppUnsavedDialog, one
 * for the whole app) : Save and leave (when the page says how it saves), Leave without
 * saving, or Close to stay. Closing or reloading the tab
 * can only ask in the browser's own words. The router guard and the reload guard have to be
 * registered separately - neither covers the other.
 *
 * @param {import('vue').Ref<boolean>} isDirty
 * @param {() => string} message Lazily read, so the locale is resolved at prompt time.
 * @param {() => Promise<boolean|void>} [save] The page's own save (its Save button) : offered
 *   as Save and leave. It returns false (or throws) when the save was refused.
